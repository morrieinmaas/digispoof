Installation
----
We differentiate between two ways of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on a development or production environment.

#### Local installation
Make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your local machine. Then clone the repository to a directory through the [``git clone`` command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [``git kraken``](https://www.gitkraken.com). If successful, navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in the terminal and run:

```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the Docker image and run the used containers. When the log from the PHP container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections" prints, you are ready to view the documentation at [localhost](http://127.0.0.1/).

#### Installation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a Haven compliant Commonground component, this component is installable on Kubernetes through Helm. The Helm files can be found in the API/Helm folder. For installing this component through Helm, open your terminal and run
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in-depth installation guide, you can refer to the [installation guide](/api/helm) included within the Helm files. It also has a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world.
